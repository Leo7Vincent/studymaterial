            <b>Question 1. What is history? What is the origin of the world history’?</b><br>
            Answer: History is the study of our past, a record of the events that happened long ago. It tells us about the life of people during a particular period. The word ‘History’ comes from the Greek word ‘Histo’ which means ‘know this’.

            Answer: ‘Pre-history’ means ‘before history’. This period refers to the era when man had not developed the art of writing. Hence, there are no written records of this period. The life of people during this period is constructed through tools, weapons, bones, etc.

            <b>Question 4. Name two sources of history. What do literary sources include?</b><br>
            Answer: Two sources of history are literary sources and archaeological sources. Literary sources include secular literature and religious literature.
