            <b>Question 4. How did the battle of Kalinga affect Ashoka?</b><br>
            Answer: In 261 BC, Ashoka led the Mauryan army in an invasion of Kalinga, ultimately securing victory. However, the war came at a devastating cost—100,000 people lost their lives, and 150,000 were taken as prisoners. The widespread suffering, particularly among women and children, deeply affected Ashoka. Witnessing the destruction firsthand, he was overcome with sorrow, marking a turning point in his life. From that moment, he renounced warfare and committed himself to promoting peace and harmony. His transformation led to the spread of Dhamma, emphasizing non-violence and moral governance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 5. Write a short note on Mauryan administration.</b><br>
            Answer: Important functionaries in Mauryan administration were called tirthas. The highest functionaries were minister (Mantri), high priest (Purohita), commander-in-chief (Senapati) and crown-prince (Yuvaraja).

However, the war came at a devastating cost—100,000 people lost their lives, and 150,000 were taken as prisoners. The widespread suffering, particularly among women and children, deeply affected Ashoka. Witnessing the destruction firsthand, he was overcome with sorrow, marking a turning point in his life. From that moment, he renounced warfare and committed himself to promoting peace and harmony. His transformation led to the spread of Dhamma, emphasizing non-violence and moral governance.
