    <h2>IV. Answer the following questions:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <b>Question 1. Why is Chandragupta I called the real founder of the Gupta Empire?</b><br>
            Answer: Chandragupta I is called the real founder of the Gupta Empire because he was first independent and important ruler of this dynasty. He raised the power and prestige of his empire through conquests and marriages. He assumed the title **Maharajadhiraja**, i.e., ‘the king of kings’. He started the Gupta Era in 320 AD which marked the date of his accession.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 2. Describe the military achievements of Samudragupta. Which source tells us about him?</b><br>
            Answer: The **Allahabad Pillar Inscription**, composed by Harisena, serves as the most significant historical record of Samudragupta’s reign. It highlights his military prowess, detailing his victories across northern and southern India. In the north, he defeated nine rulers, while in the eastern Deccan and southern regions, he overcame twelve kings. However, rather than annexing these southern territories, he chose to collect tributes from the defeated rulers, recognizing the challenges of governing distant lands from his capital. This strategy allowed him to amass vast treasures, reinforcing his dominance without direct territorial control.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 3. Why is Chandragupta II considered the greatest ruler of the Gupta dynasty?</b><br>
            Answer: **Fa-Hien’s** account forms the historical source of information about Chandragupta II. Chandragupta II was a great conqueror. His greatest achievement was to destroy the power of the **Shaka** from Malwa, Gujarat and Saurashtra permanently. He gained control over three important ports of Bharuch, Cambay and Sopara. He also assumed the title **Shakari** or ‘the conqueror of the Shakas’. He was a great patron of art and literature. He had at his court, the famous **Navaratnas**, the most learned men of his time. Poet Kalidasa was one of them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 4. What were the religious beliefs of the people during the Gupta period?</b><br>
            Answer: The Gupta kings were Vaishnavas, but they were tolerant towards all religions. **Brahmanism** had come to the forefront. The two gods who commanded the worship of the majority were Vishnu and Shiva. Religious sacrifices were performed. Hinduism became the most powerful religion and the Gupta kings gave donations for building of temples. Buddhism no longer received the royal patronage, though it continued to be the second most important religion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 5. Describe the great progress made in art and architecture during the Gupta period.</b><br>
            Answer: Art and architecture gained great heights during the Gupta Period. Many temples were built. The temples at Deogarh, Sanchi and Bhittargaon are very famous. The 29 cave temples at Ajanta near Aurangabad in Maharashtra and Bagh in Madhya Pradesh were also built during this period. The walls of these caves were covered with paintings (called murals or frescoes). Two main centers of art were Mathura and Sarnath. The image of the seated Buddha in a yogic pose is one of the masterpieces of art of this period.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 6. With examples prove that Sanskrit literature reached its peak during this period.</b><br>
            Answer: The Gupta period is called the **Golden Age of Sanskrit literature**. Chandragupta II is credited with maintaining **Nav-Ratna** (Nine luminaries) at his court. Kalidasa and Amarasimha adorned his court. Kalidasa was the greatest and most famous poet of this period. He wrote **Abhijnana Shakuntalam, Raghuvansham, Meghaduta** and **Kumar Sambhava**. Amarsimha wrote **Amarakosa**, a Sanskrit dictionary. Panini was a great grammarian. **Ashtadhyayi**, the greatest work on Sanskrit grammar was written by Panini during this period.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 7. Describe the progress made in the field of science during the Gupta period.</b><br>
            Answer: Scientists, mathematicians, astronomers and physicians flourished in the court of the Gupta rulers. Two well-known mathematicians and astronomers of this period were **Aryabhatta** and **Varahamihira**. Aryabhatta said that the earth moves round the sun and at the same time it moves on its axis. The books authored by Aryabhatta are **Aryabhatiya** and **Suryasidhanta**. Varahamihira wrote **Brihat Samhita**, an Encyclopedia on Astronomy. Indian mathematicians knew the use of **zero**. The Indians also used the **decimal system**.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 8. Write a short note on Gupta administration.</b><br>
            Answer: The Gupta Empire was systematically organized into provinces, each known as a **Bhukti**. These provinces were further divided into districts, referred to as **Vishayas**, which were then subdivided into villages called **gramas**. Governance at each level was carefully structured—**Uparikas** were appointed to oversee the Bhuktis, while **Vishayapatis** managed the Vishayas. To ensure efficient administration, district councils assisted provincial governors in decision-making. The provinces were entrusted to princes, who were supported by officials known as **Kumarmatyas**. At the village level, **Gramapatis** were responsible for local governance, ensuring smooth functioning within their communities. This well-organized system contributed to the stability and prosperity of the Gupta Empire.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 9. With appropriate examples prove that the Gupta period has been rightly called a ‘Golden Age’.</b><br>
            Answer: The Gupta period is known as “Golden Age of Indian History”. The rule of the Gupta kings lasted for more than two hundred years.
