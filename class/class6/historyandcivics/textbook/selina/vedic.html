            Answer: Though there are different theories regarding the origin of the Aryans, the theory provided by Max Mueller is most popular. According to his opinion, the Aryans came from Central Asia in about 1500 BC.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 2. Which gods and goddesses were worshiped by the Aryans during the Early Vedic Period? Describe the changes that took place in their religion in the Later Vedic Period.</b><br>
            Answer: In the Early Vedic period, the Aryans revered natural elements, worshipping forces such as the sun, earth, sky, wind, rain, and fire. Among their most significant deities were Indra, the god of rain, storms, and war; Varun, the god of water; Agni, the fire deity; and Surya, the sun god. Their religious practices included yajnas (sacrificial rituals), prayers, and the chanting of hymns.
            As time progressed into the Later Vedic period, religious customs became more intricate. The prominence of early gods like Indra, Agni, and Varun diminished, making way for the worship of Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the preserver; and Shiva, the destroyer. Rituals, sacrifices, and yajnas became increasingly elaborate, reflecting the evolving spiritual beliefs of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 3. On what basis was the Aryan society divided? Mention the functions of each social group.</b><br>
            Answer: The ‘Varna’ system was an important feature of the Vedic society. There were four Vamas — Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras. Brahmans were teachers and priests. Kshatriyas were rulers and warriors. Farmers and traders formed the Vaishya group. Shudras served all the three classes, did menial jobs and consisted of artisans and labourers. Towards the end of the Later Vedic period, occupations became hereditary and people from the same occupation formed a specific vama. The vama system became very rigid and inflexible. Vama system became hereditary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 4. How did the Aryans amuse themselves?</b><br>
            Answer: Chariot racing, hunting, gambling, Singing, dancing, playing musical instruments were the favourite amusements of the Aryans. They loved to play the game of dice which was very popular. Flute, dram and lute were favourite instruments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 5. Describe the political organisation of the Aryans during the ‘Later Vedic Period.</b><br>
            Answer: Small tribal organisations of Early Vedic period expanded and became powerful and turned into large kingdoms. The position of Rajan (king) became stronger. He gained absolute power and his position became hereditary. Powerful kings performed elaborate and complex sacrifices such as Ashwamedh, Vajapeya and Rajasuya sacrifices. The commander-in-chief, ‘Senani,’ became very important. The ‘ Sangrihitri’ or tax collector became a very important officer. The two assemblies, Sabha and Samiti lost their importance and their powers were taken away by the king. Nevertheless, these organisations continued to exist and were dominated by the rich and influential people.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 6. Compare the position of women during the Early Vedic Period and the Later Vedic Period.</b><br>
            Answer: During the Early Vedic period, women were respected and given a high status in society. They even attended the assemblies and participated in debates. The wife was the husband’s partner in all social and religious ceremonies. Girls had the freedom to choose their husbands through the system of ‘ Swayamvara’. But during the Later Vedic period, society became patriarchal as most prayers contained the desire to have a son. The position of women deteriorated during the period. Women were considered inferior to men and were denied education. Their freedom was curtailed. Polygamy was practiced. They were supposed to serve their families and were confined to the four walls of their houses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 7. What difference do you find in the position of the King of the Early Vedic Age as compared to the King of the Later Vedic Age?</b><br>
            Answer: In the Early Vedic period, the Rajan, or tribal leader, held the responsibility of safeguarding his people and their territory through warfare. His position was not hereditary, and his authority was kept in check by two important tribal assemblies—the Sabha and Samiti. The Rajan was typically chosen by tribal elders based on his courage and wisdom, rather than lineage.
            As society evolved into the Later Vedic period, the king’s role became more powerful and absolute. His position became hereditary, and he began to assert himself as a divine representative. To strengthen his rule and prestige, he conducted elaborate sacrificial rituals such as Ashwamedha, Vajapeya, and Rajasuya. Additionally, he adopted grand titles like ‘Samrat’ and ‘Mahadhiraj’, signifying his supreme authority.
