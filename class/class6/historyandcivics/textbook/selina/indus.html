    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <b>Question 1. Who discovered the Indus Valley Civilisation and when?</b><br>
            Answer: Mr. Daya Ram Sahni discovered the ruins of Harappa in 1921. Next year, in 1922 Dr. Rachal Das Bannerjee discovered the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 2. What does civilisation mean? Give four characteristics of a civilisation.</b><br>
            Answer: The stage of development when man looks for more than just fulfillment of his basic needs, is called civilisation.<br>
            <b>Characteristics of a civilisation:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Surplus food production</li>
                <li>Flourishing of many arts and crafts</li>
                <li>Law and order exists</li>
                <li>Presence of a government.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 3. Why did the earliest civilisations grow up near rivers?</b><br>
            Answer: The earliest civilisations grew up on the banks of rivers because of the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>The rivers provided abundant supply of water for various purposes all through the year.</li>
                <li>The lands near the rivers were very fertile, hence good for growing crops.</li>
                <li>Rivers provided means of transport and communication.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 4. Name the different sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation.</b><br>
            Answer: Various sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation were —The river valleys had warm and pleasant climate which favoured permanent settlement of population. Harappa, Mohenjodaro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Ropar, Alamgirpur, Banwali, Sutkagendor and others.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 5. Describe the town planning and the drainage system of the Indus Valley Civilisation.</b><br>
            Answer: The cities were organized into two distinct sections. The elevated area, known as the ‘citadel,’ was designated for the upper class and featured important public buildings such as granaries. The lower section housed the general population. Residences were designed with a central courtyard, multiple surrounding rooms, a toilet, and a well. Structures across the city were built using durable burnt bricks. Large housing blocks lined both sides of the streets, which were laid out in a systematic grid. The main roads were wide, straight, and intersected at right angles, with smaller streets connecting to larger ones. Streetlights illuminated the pathways.<br>
            The drainage system was exceptionally advanced—far superior to many modern towns. Household drains led into street drains, which connected to larger main drains before emptying beyond the city limits. Stone slabs covered these drainage channels, and manholes were strategically placed at intervals for easy maintenance. Regular cleaning ensured efficiency. The people of the Indus Valley exhibited a remarkable commitment to hygiene and sanitation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 6. Describe the Great Bath. Where has it been found? What was it used for?</b><br>
            Answer: The Great Bath was a sort of modern swimming pool, discovered at Mohenjodaro. It is an example of excellent engineering ‘work. It was built of burnt brick. It measures 11.88 x 7.01 metres.<br>
            (The repeated sentences about fertile lands and transport in the original text seem to be misplaced here.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 7. Describe the Great Granary. Where has it been found?</b><br>
            Answer: The Great Granary was found at Mohenjodaro and it was the largest building discovered there. It was used for storing grains in huge quantities for lean periods. Brick platforms have been found near the granaries which were used for threshing grain. Many two-room shelters have also been found nearby which were perhaps used by labourers. Granaries were built close to river banks to facilitate easier transportation of grains during emergencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 8. Describe the religion of Indus Valley Civilisation</b><br>
            Answer: The Harappans worshiped the pipal tree and humped bull which have been found on hundreds of seals. They also worshiped Mother Goddess which were beautifully depicted as terracotta figurines. The Harappans also worshiped ‘Shiva’ or ‘Pashupati’. A three-faced figure with horns has been found sitting in the posture of a yogi. He is surrounded by a tiger, a rhinoceros, a buffalo, and an elephant. But no temple or any other religious building has been found so far.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 9. Name the three social classes of the Indus Valley Civilisation.</b><br>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 10. What were the probable causes which could have brought about an abrupt end to the Indus Valley Civilisation?</b><br>
            Answer: There are many reasons attributed to the fall of the Indus Valley Civilisation:
            <ul>
                <li>The Harappan cities were destroyed by invaders who were probably the Aryans.</li>
                <li>Natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes and epidemics might have destroyed the civilisation.</li>
                <li>River Indus might have changed its course and turned the region into a desert.</li>
