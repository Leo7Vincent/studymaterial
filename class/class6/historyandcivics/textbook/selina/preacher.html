    <h2>Answer the following questions:</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <b>Question 1. Why did new religions rise in India in the 6th century BC?</b><br>
            Answer: By the 6th century BC the Vedic religion had become very complicated. There was a great deal of emphasis on rituals, yajnas and sacrifice. The Brahmanas had become very powerful and all the rituals had become too costly for the common man. Animal sacrifices affected the economy because it was based upon agriculture and animal husbandry. The language used for all rituals was Sanskrit and the common man could not understand it. The use of coins facilitated trade and commerce which added to the importance of the Vaishyas. They were ranked third in the society, the first two being Brahmanas and Kshatriyas. Naturally, they looked for a religion which would improve their position. Hence, new religions — Buddhism and Jainism — rose in India in the 6th century BC.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 2. What are the five vows a Jain householder had to take?</b><br>
            Answer: Five vows of Jainism are as follow:
            <ul>
                <li>Ahimsa—non-violence</li>
                <li>Satya—Truth</li>
                <li>Acharya or Asteya—Non-stealing</li>
                <li>Brahmacharya—Celibacy</li>
                <li>Aparigraha—non-possession</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 3. Why did Buddha renounce the world?</b><br>
            Answer: One day Prince Siddhartha, while on a chariot ride through the city, saw three sights — of an old man, a sick man and a dead body being carried by mourners. This disturbed and distressed him. Then he saw an ascetic who was serene and calm. No sorrow or worldly miseries affected him. These are the Four Great Sights that changed his life and he renounced the world.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 4. Explain the main difference between Jainism and Buddhism.</b><br>
            Answer: Compared to Jainism, Buddhism was moderate in its stress on the doctrine of non-violence. Buddhism emphasised on following the middle path whereas Jainism laid stress on extreme austerity. While the Buddha was silent about the existence of God, Mahavira denied his existence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 5. Why did Buddhism spread so rapidly?</b><br>
            Answer: Buddhism spread rapidly because its teachings were very simple and it was taught in the language of the people. The patronage of two great emperors — Ashoka and Kanishka — made it a world religion. Its opposition to the caste system made it popular among the castes that were considered low.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 6. What were the reasons behind the decline of Buddhism and Jainism?</b><br>
            Answer: Buddhism, which initially opposed the rigid practices of Brahmanism, eventually fell into similar patterns. Over time, Buddhist monks became increasingly detached from everyday society. They abandoned **Pali**, the common language, in favor of **Sanskrit**, which was primarily used by scholars. Idol worship became widespread, and monks began accepting material offerings from devotees. With generous royal grants, monastic life turned luxurious, leading to corruption within Buddhist monasteries by the **7th century AD**, contradicting Buddha’s original teachings. Similarly, Jainism faced challenges in its expansion. Its strict adherence to **non-violence** limited its appeal among farmers, whose livelihood required dealing with pests and insects. Mahavira’s principles were also difficult for artisans and craftsmen, whose work sometimes endangered living creatures. Additionally, Jainism’s rigid stance on **private property** was interpreted as a restriction on land ownership, further hindering its growth. These factors contributed to the gradual decline of both Buddhism and Jainism.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 7. Name the religious texts of Buddhism and Jainism.</b><br>
            Answer: Religious texts of Buddhism — Vinay Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Religious texts of Jainism — Angas and Purva’s.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 8. Why is Buddhism called the Middle Path?</b><br>
            Answer: Buddhism is called Middle Path because Buddha did not believe in extremes. Buddhism emphasised on following the middle.
