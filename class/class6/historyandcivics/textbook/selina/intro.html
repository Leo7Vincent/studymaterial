They were used as spears, arrow heads, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question 6. Describe the main features of the Neolithic Age?</b><br>
            Answer: During the Neolithic Age man learnt to make better tools, grow food crops and domesticate animals. This age is remarkable for the discovery of agriculture, fine pottery and invention of the wheel. Man became a food-producer and began leading a settled life.

        <li>
            <b>Question 8. Trace the development of early man from being a food gatherer to a food producer.</b><br>
            Answer: During the Palaeolithic Age, early man was a food gatherer. He wandered from place to place in search of food. He hunted wild animals for their meat which they ate raw. With the discovery of fire, he learnt to roast meat. During the Neolithic Age early man began to grow food crops. He became a food-producer. Hence, he settled at one place, began domestication of useful animals and stored grains for future use in pots.
